# Azure IoT Edge OPC Proxy API

Using the Azure IoT Edge OPC Reverse Proxy API, client applications can connect to devices in a local gateway network and exchange transparent payloads, allowing developers to implement applications in Azure where the command and control protocol layer resides in the cloud.Â 

The OPC proxy edge gateway module itself can be found at https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-opc-proxy.

# Getting started

> Before you run the proxy or any of the included samples, you must obtain a service manage *connection string* for your IoT Hub. You can use the *iothubowner* connection string (going forward referred to as **<*iothubownerconnectionstring>**) which can easily be found on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) in the "Shared Access Policies" section of the [IoT hub settings blade](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal#change-the-settings-of-the-iot-hub). For more information checkout out the documentation [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/setup_iothub.md).

The required proxy gateway can be built and run directly from github using [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker):
```
docker build -t proxyd https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge-opc-proxy.git
docker run -it proxyd -c "<*iothubownerconnectionstring>"
``` 

# Samples

> For simplicity, all samples read the <*iothubownerconnectionstring> from the  ```_HUB_CS ``` environment variable.  If you do not set this variable on your machine the included samples will not work!  However, make sure you safeguard the connection string properly on your development machine and do not develop against a production IoT Hub.    

The following samples are included to demonstrate the use of the .net API:

- An [OPC UA client](/api/csharp/samples/opc-ua/readme.md) that shows how the [OPC-Foundation reference stack](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandardLibrary) can be used to relay OPC UA from the cloud to machines in a local gateway network. 

- PNetCat - A [Netcat like proxy client](/api/csharp/samples/netcat/readme.md) that you can use to interact
with an arbitrary host and port in the proxy network and for example tunnel SSH using the ssh proxy option.  It supports port bridge server and stdin/stdout netcat mode.

- A [Simple TCP/IP services client](/api/csharp/samples/simple/tcp/readme.md) that demonstrates different socket API calls.

- A [Browser client](/api/csharp/samples/simple/dns/readme.md) that uses the remote browsing capabilities of the proxy.  Use it to enumerate services and resolve host names across all proxies.

- A simple [Reverse HTTP Web Proxy](/api/csharp/samples/http/readme.md) that shows how you can access a web server in the proxy network through a reverse Web proxy Server implemented using ASP.Net Core and Kestrel.
